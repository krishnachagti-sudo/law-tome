// When did this page actually change? (pure, no I/O)
//
// The old answer was "today", on every page, on every build. `buildSitemap`
// took one date and wrote it into all 1,785 <lastmod> elements, and the law
// template put the same date in `dateModified` and `datePublished`. The comment
// in partials.mjs defended it: the corpus carries no per-entry authoring date
// and the whole site is regenerated each deploy, so the build date was "the only
// honest answer".
//
// It was the only CHEAP answer. It was not honest, and it was not even inert.
// Google's documentation is explicit that it uses <lastmod> "if it's
// consistently and verifiably (for example by comparing to the last modification
// of the page) accurate" — so a value that claims 1,116 untouched entries all
// changed this morning is not a missing signal, it is a signal that teaches
// Google to discard the field. A sitemap with no <lastmod> at all would have
// been strictly better than what we were shipping.
//
// The real answer is available and always was: a page changed when its rendered
// bytes changed. Hash the render, keep the hash in a committed manifest, and
// only move the date when the hash moves.
//
// The one trick that makes it work in a single pass:
//
//   The date is part of the page. `article:modified_time` and `dateModified`
//   are rendered into the HTML, so hashing the finished page would fold today's
//   date into the hash, every page would differ from yesterday, and the whole
//   scheme would reproduce the bug it exists to fix. So the page is rendered
//   with a TOKEN where the date goes, hashed with the hole still in it, and only
//   stamped with a real date once that date has been decided. The hash is
//   therefore a function of the content alone, which is the only thing it should
//   ever have depended on.
