// Quiz page — "Name that law", and three other ways to be wrong about a law.
//
// A static shell filled by src/assets/quiz.js, which fetches the prebuilt search
// index and runs a ten-question round. The law of the day used to share this
// page; it now opens the home page, where people actually arrive, and this page
// is the game alone.
//
// Four question modes, all answerable from data the index already carries — no
// new build artefact, no claim the corpus cannot back:
//   1. Name that law     — a statement, four names.
//   2. What does it say? — a name, four statements.
//   3. Which field?      — a law, four disciplines.
//   4. How reliable?     — a law, the four rating tiers.
// The last is the one worth playing: the whole point of rating every entry is
// that a measured finding and a catchy saying look identical until you check.
//
// With JS off the shell says so and points at the index — no dead page.

Every answer links straight to the law's page — the fastest way through the round is to read the ones you miss. <a href="${base}browse/">The index</a> is the study material; <a href="${base}reliability/">the reliability scale</a> is what the fourth mode is testing.`,

      a: 'The daily round is the same ten questions, in the same order, with the same wrong answers, for everybody who plays on that date — which is what makes a score worth sharing. Once you finish it, the page shows you what you scored rather than handing you a second go. That record lives in your own browser, so nothing stops a determined person from clearing it; it is there to keep the ordinary path honest, not to police it. Endless mode draws a fresh random round whenever you want one and keeps no record at all — it is the one to practise on.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Does the shared grid give the answers away?',
      a: 'No. It is a row of green and red squares in the order you answered them, plus the score — enough to compare two people’s rounds, and not enough to help anybody who has not played yet. The names of the laws are never in it.',

// ---- the score pages ---------------------------------------------------------
//
// Eleven pages, /quiz/score/0/ through /quiz/score/10/, each the landing place
// for a shared result. They exist for one reason: a score pasted into a chat is
// a bare number until it carries a link, and a link is ignored until it unfurls
// into a picture. Each of these names its own quote-card as its og:image, so
// "8/10" arrives as a card that says 8/10.
//
// They are marked noindex. A search engine has nothing to gain from eleven
// near-identical pages about a number, and the site does not need the traffic
// badly enough to publish thin pages to get it. `follow` is kept, so the links
// out of them still count and a crawler that lands on one leaves by the front
// door. They are excluded from the sitemap for the same reason.
//
// The wording is careful on one point. The page cannot know whose score it is
// or whether anybody actually got it — a static file has no way to check — so
// it never says "you scored" or "they scored". It says what the score is worth
// and invites the reader to go and get their own.
