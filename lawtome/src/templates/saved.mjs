// Saved page (/saved/) — the reader's private shortlist.
//
// A static shell filled by src/assets/saved.js from localStorage (no account, no
// server, nothing leaves the browser). Every law page carries a Save button; the
// ones you save show up here. With JS off it explains itself and points to
// Browse — never a dead page.
//
// The page a reader arrives at is, by construction, empty the first time — so
// most of what is written here is for that visit: what saving is, where the
// list lives, and what it costs (nothing, and no account). An empty page that
// explains itself is a page; an empty page that says "nothing saved yet" is a
// dead end.
